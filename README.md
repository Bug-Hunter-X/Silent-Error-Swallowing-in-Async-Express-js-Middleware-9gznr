# Silent Error Swallowing in Async Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: silently swallowing errors that occur within asynchronous middleware.  When an asynchronous operation within a route handler throws an error, the Express app doesn't handle it gracefully, resulting in an unhandled rejection.  This can make debugging and maintaining the application difficult.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js application with an asynchronous route handler that might throw an error.  However, there's no proper error handling to catch and log this error.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle errors in async middleware. Using `try...catch` blocks is a more reliable error handling solution. This ensures that errors are caught and logged or handled accordingly, avoiding the silent failure scenario.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies (if any).
4. Run `node bug.js` to run the application with the unhandled error.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to run the application with the improved error handling.

Observe the difference in console output and behavior between the two versions.
